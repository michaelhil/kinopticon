# POC v1 Archive

This directory contains the original proof-of-concept implementation archived on 2025-09-26.

## What was implemented
- Basic terrain generation with height maps
- Simple point-based road system
- Graph-based driving with OSM integration
- Basic entities (cars, pedestrians)
- Interactive controls and sliders
- Mini-map with route tracking
- Road edge lines visualization

## Why archived
This implementation served as a valuable proof-of-concept but had fundamental limitations:
- No lane awareness (cars drove on road center)
- Linear geometry only (jerky turns)
- No traffic rules or proper intersection handling
- Limited scalability

## Migration to v2
The v2 implementation (Phase 1) introduces:
- Proper lane-based road system
- Smooth curve geometry
- Realistic intersections with traffic rules
- Industry-standard data format compatibility
- Enhanced OSM import with lane inference

## Files
- All original POC files preserved as-is
- Original type definitions, driving systems, controls, etc.
- Working implementation that can be restored if needed
